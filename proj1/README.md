### OpenWaters

OpenWaters is a drawing application that was inspired by the dynamic 
interactions between natural landscapes of the earth with water and 
the sky. Exiting the welcome stage, this application first generates a 
background environment that takes into account and reflects the user's 
time of day (ie. sunset, midday, twilight, and dusk). The user is 
limited to drawing on only the 'land' portion of the canvas, which 
lets the user explore interactions between his/her drawings on 
'land' and their representations in water - to show that reflections do not always mirror the landscape. Users are instructed with verbal 
instructions before entering the game; after entering the game, however, 
no more verbal instructions are present, and they are given 3 different
brush options through graphic representations of the brush type, as well
as which keys to hold to select the brush.
